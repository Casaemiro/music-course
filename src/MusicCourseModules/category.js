There are tonnes of different types of musical instruments that exist in different cultures and different genres. The different instruments produce different sounds because they have different mechanisms of functionality. Musical instruments are classified based on how they produce thier sound. Generally, we have 4 categories: <span className='extra-link'>Woodwind</span>, <span className='extra-link'>Brass</span>, <span className='extra-link'>Percussive</span> and <span className='extra-link'>Stringed</span> instruments.</p>

                The video above covers an overview of the categories of musical instruments. The next few lessons will be a little bit more detailed and will cover each of the categories.
