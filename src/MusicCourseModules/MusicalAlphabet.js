                All musical instruments produce sounds which are called notes and all the instruments each have a different mechanism of producing the notes. For the piano, it has a keyboard where each key produces a note when pressed. The fute has holes whereby closing different holes or combination of holes and then blowing produces different notes. For the guitar, it has strings which can be plucked to produce different notes depending on which string is plucked and the particular fret position that is held down. Don't bother yourself if you do not understand all of these because it will be explained in detail later on. The point here is, <b>any instrument can be used to produce different notes</b>. Now an interesting question can arise from here: How many notes exist alltogether or How many notes can each instrument produce seeing that a piano has many keys. The answer to this is simple. There are 12 notes in western music. and regardless of the number of keys a piano has or the total number of frets and strings a guitar has, they are just a repeatition of these 12 notes. Thus for example if a piano has 60 keys, then it just repeats these 12 notes 5 times and same principle applies for other instruments. These 12 notes are named using the musical alphabet.<br/><br/>The musical alphabet is made up of 7 letters which are the first 7 letters of the english alphabet. That is; <b>A,B,C,D,E,F and G.</b> Now you may be wondering how just 7 letters will be used to name the 12 notes. This will be covered in the lessons ahead. Nevertheless, begining from the next lesson, we will introduce the piano with the main aim of using it to illustrate the concept of 12 musical notes as well as using the musical alphabet to name these notes.
