            <p className="intro-text"><span className='extra-link'>Music</span> has been around for ages and is used in defferent fields and for different reasons. Some people use music for pleasure, relaxation, source of income, information, for <span className="extra-link">religious purposes</span> or a combination of diverse reasons. But what is common in most if not all  of them is that music acts as a tool for conveying information/emotions.<br/><br/>That said, music does not neccesarily have to be pleasing to the ear since that is subjective to the listener. Many people have different views as to what music really is. thus we will not be settling on a particular definition but we'll be giving a broad description.</p>
